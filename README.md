# NSEAnalysis
Tool to gather and explore equity prices from the Nairobi Securities Exchange. NSE does not provide an easy way to do this so I maintain a 
database of stock prices. The data current data has at most a fidelity of 30 minutes. It doesn't make sense sampling at any higher rate 
since for most companies, prices are constant over a long period of time. 

My hope is to provide an clean API and tools to collect, and visualize the data in a painless way. I plan to add earnings reports, company
news releases, and other datasets.
